- KL(): If an analytical (differentiable) form exits for K-L divergence
        between copulas, we could propose an interesting extension.
        (Simpler) extensions to consider first: encoder maps to non-diagonal
        covariance matrix, Kendall matrix (which we then transform to covariance
        matrix for use in KL()).
