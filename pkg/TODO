## Short-term
- Implement three progress bars (see test.R):
  1) one line per epoch but include loss
  2) max. 10 lines of epoch output with loss
  3) progress bar (=> make sure .Rout is not messed up => test)
- Use the progress bar/output functions in fitGNN(, callbacks = NULL)
- Use all new methods in all demos => update ./old/2021-01-01_demo

## Medium-term
- implement and export constructor for superclass gnn_Model (slots model and type)
- implement and export methods rModel, fitModel, save/load
- incorporate S4 methods of 'copula' as S3 methods in gnn (objects, rCopula, fitCopula)

## Long-term
- plot method: what to use as 'low' and 'up' values to evaluate NN at (low,...,low,up,low,...,low)?
- Fix: Paper citations (2019 on arXiv or the real publication if published)
- KL(): If an analytical (differentiable) form exits for K-L divergence
        between copulas, we could propose an interesting extension.
        (Simpler) extensions to consider first: encoder maps to non-diagonal
        covariance matrix, Kendall matrix (which we then transform to covariance
        matrix for use in KL()).
