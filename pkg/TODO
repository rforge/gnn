## Short-term
- Fix: Paper citations from arXiv (once published)

## Medium-term
- export (very small doc) ./R/model.R classes and methods:
  + implement and export methods rModel, fitModel, save/load, print, etc.
  + incorporate S4 methods of 'copula' as S3 methods in gnn (objects, rCopula, fitCopula)

## Long-term ideas
- Would be good to incorporate LSTMs ("gnn_LSTM", "gnn_GNN", "gnn_Model") based on keras
- KL(): If an analytical (differentiable) form exits for K-L divergence
        between copulas, we could propose an interesting extension.
        (Simpler) extensions to consider first: encoder maps to non-diagonal
        covariance matrix, Kendall matrix (which we then transform to covariance
        matrix for use in KL()).
