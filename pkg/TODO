## Short-term
- rename all 'gnn' args to 'x'
- plot method: what to use as 'low' and 'up' values to evaluate NN at (low,...,low,up,low,...,low)?
- fitGNN (call train but do progress bar and time measurement per epochs as output)
  and use them
- 'save' and 'load' methods that execute as.raw and as.keras and use save and load
- Use all new methods in all demos
- re-run all ./demo files and check
- perhaps remove all demos and saved NNs and store them locally

- implement and export constructor for class gnn_Model (slots model and type)
- implement and export methods rModel, fitModel
- incorporate S4 methods of 'copula' as S3 methods in gnn (objects, rCopula, fitCopula)
- use them all in demos
- re-run and check demos

## Long-term
- Fix: Paper citations (2019 on arXiv or the real publication if published)
- KL(): If an analytical (differentiable) form exits for K-L divergence
        between copulas, we could propose an interesting extension.
        (Simpler) extensions to consider first: encoder maps to non-diagonal
        covariance matrix, Kendall matrix (which we then transform to covariance
        matrix for use in KL()).
